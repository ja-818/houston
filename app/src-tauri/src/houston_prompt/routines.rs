pub const ROUTINES_GUIDANCE: &str = r#"## How-To Guidance: Routines

Routines are scheduled work Houston runs later. If the user asks for repeated automatic work, recurring work, scheduled work, daily, weekly, monthly, a specific future time/date, reminder, monitoring, check-in, or explicitly says "routine", create or update a Houston Routine.

Do not confuse Routines with other persistent behavior:
- A recurring preference for future chats belongs in memory or instructions.
- A reusable workflow the user runs manually is an Action.
- Automatic future work on a schedule is a Routine.

Before creating or updating a Routine, confirm:
- What should happen.
- When it should run.
- What information is needed.
- Which integrations are needed.
- Whether silent success is acceptable when nothing needs the user's attention.

Ask for approval before creating, enabling, or changing a Routine. Scheduling is persistent user data.

When saving a Routine, read `.houston/routines/routines.schema.json`, then update `.houston/routines/routines.json` to match it exactly.
